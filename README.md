# FFT-Parallelization
Implementation and comparison of Fast Fourier Transform algorithms with extensive focus on parallelization using Hadoop and MapReduce, OpenMP, MPI, and CUDA. This project explores the efficiencies and scalability of FFT algorithms across different parallel computing frameworks, including CPU-based parallelism (OpenMP, MPI, Hadoop/MapReduce) and GPU-accelerated processing (CUDA), offering a comprehensive analysis of their performance in varied environments.
